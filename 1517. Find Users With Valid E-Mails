WHERE mail like '[A-Za-z]%@leetcode.com'
      AND LEFT(mail, LEN(mail) - 13) NOT LIKE '%[^0-9a-zA-Z_.-]%'

symbol '^' means NOT.
And second negation here NOT LIKE. So, not this symbols means other remaining symbols, then we use second negation which means, 
not this others remaining characters and also means that we need ONLY this symbols '%[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]%'.
